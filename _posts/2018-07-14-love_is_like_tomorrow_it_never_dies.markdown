I fell in love with coding almost 12 years ago as a freshman in college. My aspiration at the time was to become an aerospace engineer, but I had been auto-enrolled in the class, so I took it. Programming was the furthest thing from my mind and I had no idea what to expect. I remember the professor taking us through our first program, Hello World written in C. That was the moment I was bitten by the (code) love bug, a moment after which nothing would be the same. A new world of opportunities opened up to me. I started to ponder whether software engineering would be a good fit for me (instead of my plan to pursue aerospace engineering). 

Like most young love, mine came with its share of setbacks. I made the classic newbie coder mistakes:
1. **I didn’t spend enough time practicing.** As a freshman in college, I was still getting used to juggling all of the course work I had. I didn’t really devote enough hours to learning to code.
2. **I got severely discouraged whenever I ran into a roadblock.** Instead of seeing it as a natural part of the process, I saw it as a personal failing (i.e. I’m not smart enough to do this). I doubted my ability to be successful.
3. **I didn’t read any documentation, articles, or other outside info.** I depended solely on the in-class instruction and textbook.
4. **I didn’t work on any of my own projects or explore topics of interest.** I didn’t embrace it as a hobby. Instead it was a means to an end. A means to getting a degree so I could get a job.

I also made a classic perfectionist college student mistake. I was focused on grades rather than comprehension. I was obsessed with getting “A”s. I didn’t realize that letter grades don’t really equate to knowledge, at least not practical knowledge. They also don’t equate to knowledge retention, which is key when you’re trying to build a skill like coding.

I still could have been a software engineer despite these mistakes had I not made the following grand mistake:

Making a career decision based on fear, doubt and a stale world view.

I didn’t grow up in poverty, but I did grow up without financial stability. It often felt like we (my family and I) were one setback away from (more) debt and financial ruin. This experience growing up shaped my decision making process. My pursuit of a college degree was really the pursuit of money. Pursuing money isn’t a bad goal in and of itself, but pursuing money at the expense of one’s own interests and true desires usually leads to dissatisfaction at some point. The fear of lack drove a lot of my decisions.

The doubt came from my perfectionist response to encountering problems and challenges. College is hard. Engineering is hard. Learning to program is hard. Whenever I struggled, I interpreted it as not being good enough. I felt that something was wrong with me. I didn’t recognize that struggle was a normal, natural part of the process. 

As for the stale world view, I did not know what I did not know. I was completely unplugged from the tech industry and from tech/engineering current events. I thought that pursuing electrical engineering (my ultimate major) would give me more job opportunities and job stability than software engineering. I now look back at this and laugh. I didn’t see the impending explosion of apps, mobile development and the like. I didn’t see the crucial role that software developers and engineers would have in the coming decades. I remember going into an Apple store when the first iPhone came out and thinking it was the dumbest thing. I couldn’t see why anyone would want to do more than make calls and maybe send a few text messages with their phones. I was oblivious to the revolution in technology that was right in front of me. I could only see the world that was, not the world that would be. 

With all this swirling around in my head (subconsciously of course), I chose electrical engineering. It wasn’t a bad choice; it just wasn’t the choice that aligned with my natural interests. 

Love that is deep never really dies, it just goes dormant. The urge to learn to code kept resurfacing post graduation. Every two to three years something would inevitably remind me of my days learning C and Java in college. I’d find myself wishing I stuck with it. I’d then find a book or a website that goes over coding fundamentals and follow along. Eventually I’d get confused or life would get in the way and I’d quit, only to repeat the cycle over in the future (I’ve been through the loop about three times now). This last time though, I stumbled upon Flatiron school and made the decision to go for it. It was clear that the urge to code wasn’t going to go away. Rather than ignore it, I would pursue it. I just finished my second week in the program and I am thoroughly enjoying myself, error messages, tech issues and all. 

If you’ve stuck with me this long, thank you for taking the time to read my story. I hope that it inspires you to pursue your own true interests, despite the fear and doubt that may be swirling around in your head.
